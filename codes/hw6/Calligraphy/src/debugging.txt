While doing optimizer functions, we thought we did everything correctly but the tests wouldn't pass. So we start looking at the documentation and our code again.
We figured out there's something wrong with the graph, and later realized that the nodes in the graph are not necessarily connected with each other, i.e. there might be multiple clusters.
Then we alternated our code to deal with this situation for multiple clusters, and added variables to check if there's only one longest chain, and the tests passed.
